# 🧪 Production API Test Report

**Test Date**: January 29, 2026
**API Tested**: `https://api.autojobzy.com/api`

---

## ❌ CRITICAL: Production Deployment Required!

**Production server is running OUTDATED code.** The following features tested locally are NOT working in production:

---

## 📊 Test Results Summary

| Feature | Local | Production | Status |
|---------|-------|------------|--------|
| **Naukri Verification** | ✅ 12 sec | ❌ 504 Timeout (60 sec) | **BROKEN** |
| **Resume Upload to S3** | ✅ 1 sec | ⚠️ Partial (no S3 URL) | **INCOMPLETE** |
| **Resume Delete** | ✅ Working | ❌ Endpoint Not Found | **MISSING** |

---

## 🔴 Issue 1: Naukri Verification - 504 Gateway Timeout

### Test Details:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.autojobzy.com/api/auth/verify-naukri-credentials' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -d '{"naukriUsername":"rohankadam474@gmail.com","naukriPassword":"Rohan@123"}'
```

### Response After 60 Seconds:
```html
<html>
<head><title>504 Gateway Time-out</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.28.0</center>
</body>
</html>
```

### Root Cause:
1. **Nginx timeout**: 60 seconds (too short)
2. **Verification needs**: 12-15 seconds
3. **Backend timeout**: Set to 120 seconds (but nginx times out first)

### Fix Required:
Configure nginx timeout to 120 seconds:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    proxy_connect_timeout 120s;
    proxy_send_timeout 120s;
}
```

## ⚠️ Issue 2: Resume Upload - Missing S3 URL

### Test Details:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.autojobzy.com/api/job-settings/resume' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -F 'resume=@test_resume.txt'
```

### Current Production Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Resume uploaded successfully",
  "resumeText": "ROHAN KADAM - PRODUCTION TEST\n...",
  "yearsOfExperience": "8+",
  "fileName": "prod_test_resume.txt"
}
```

### What's Missing:
- ❌ `success: true` field
- ❌ `resumeUrl` field (S3 URL)

### Expected Response (After Deployment):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Resume uploaded successfully",
  "resumeUrl": "https://autojobzy-resumes.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resumes/...",
  "resumeText": "ROHAN KADAM - PRODUCTION TEST...",
  "yearsOfExperience": "8+",
  "fileName": "prod_test_resume.txt"
}
```

### Root Cause:
Production server has old code that:
- Saves resumes locally (not to S3)
- Doesn't return S3 URL in response

### Fix Required:
Deploy latest code with S3 integration from:
- `server/routes/jobSettings.js` (updated upload endpoint)
- `server/utils/s3Upload.js` (NEW FILE - S3 utilities)

---

## 🔴 Issue 3: Resume Delete - Endpoint Not Found

### Test Details:
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.autojobzy.com/api/job-settings/resume' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```

### Production Response:
```json
{
  "error": "Endpoint not found"
}
```

### Root Cause:
DELETE endpoint doesn't exist on production server.

### Fix Required:
Deploy latest code with DELETE endpoint from:
- `server/routes/jobSettings.js` (lines 182-232)

---

## 📋 What Needs to be Deployed

### Backend Files:

1. ✅ `server/routes/auth.js` - Naukri verification timeout fix
2. ✅ `server/routes/jobSettings.js` - Resume upload/delete with S3
3. ✅ `server/utils/s3Upload.js` - NEW FILE - S3 utilities
4. ✅ `server/models/JobSettings.js` - Add resumeUrl column
5. ✅ `server/index.js` - Server timeout configuration

### Database Migration:

```sql
ALTER TABLE job_settings
ADD COLUMN resume_url TEXT NULL
COMMENT 'S3 URL of uploaded resume'
AFTER resume_file_name;
```

### Nginx Configuration:

```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    proxy_connect_timeout 120s;
    proxy_send_timeout 120s;
}
```

## ✅ Local Test Results (Proof It Works)

### Naukri Verification:
```
⏱️  Duration: 12.39 seconds
✅ Success: true
💬 Message: Credentials verified successfully!
```

### Resume Upload to S3:
```
⏱️  Duration: 1 second
✅ Success: true
☁️  S3 URL: https://autojobzy-resumes.s3...
💼 Experience: 5+ years (auto-detected)
```

### Resume Delete:
```
✅ Success: true
💬 Message: Resume deleted successfully
🗑️  File deleted from S3
✅ Database cleared
```

### Change Resume (Re-upload):
```
✅ Old file auto-deleted from S3
✅ New file uploaded
✅ New S3 URL stored
💼 Experience updated
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Quick Deploy Commands:

```bash
# 1. Commit changes locally
git add server/routes/auth.js server/routes/jobSettings.js server/utils/s3Upload.js server/index.js
git commit -m "Fix Naukri verification timeout & add S3 resume upload/delete"
git push origin main

# 2. SSH to production
ssh ec2-user@13.232.185.74

# 3. Deploy
cd /home/autojobzy/Job_automate
git pull origin main
npm install

# 4. Run database migration
# (See PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for migration script)

# 5. Restart server
pm2 restart job-automate-api

# 6. Configure nginx timeout
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Add: proxy_read_timeout 120s;
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# 7. Test
curl 'https://api.autojobzy.com/api/auth/verify-naukri-credentials' \

## ⏰ Deployment Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - Production features are broken/missing:

1. 🔴 **Naukri Verification** - Currently returns 504 timeout
2. ⚠️ **Resume Upload** - Works but doesn't return S3 URL (incomplete)
3. 🔴 **Resume Delete** - Endpoint doesn't exist

---

## ✅ Expected After Deployment

| Feature | Current | After Deploy |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Naukri Verification | ❌ 504 Timeout | ✅ Success (12-15 sec) |
| Resume Upload | ⚠️ No S3 URL | ✅ Returns S3 URL |
| Resume Delete | ❌ Not Found | ✅ Deletes from S3 + DB |
| Change Resume | ❌ N/A | ✅ Auto-deletes old file |
